# Supported languages

What code2graph can turn into structural facts — what's supported today, at what depth, and what's
planned. One table; only languages we'll **never** support are kept out of it (see the end).

> **The canonical, always-current set is the `Language` enum + extension dispatch in
> [`src/lang.rs`](../src/lang.rs).** This page is hand-maintained; if it disagrees with the code, the
> code wins. "Supported" = **extraction depth** (what facts we emit), not merely "the file parses."

## Legend

**Resolution tiers** (both behind the `Resolver` trait — see [README](../README.md#resolution-tiers)):

- **Tier A** (`SymbolTableResolver`) — name-based, recall-first, **available for _every_ language**.
  An ambiguous name links to all same-named definitions (`NameOnly`, or `Scoped` when globally
  unique). The universal floor under every row below.
- **Tier B** (`ScopeGraphResolver`) — scope-aware (lexical scopes, imports, qualified paths),
  `Scoped`/`Exact`, never fakes precision. Available where the extractor emits `scopes` + `bindings`.

**Status & depth** (one marker per language = the _highest_ tier it reaches, on top of Tier-A):

- ⭐ **supported · Tier-B, oracle-measured** — scope-aware resolution with ref→def precision/recall
  scored against an external SCIP oracle (rust-analyzer / scip-typescript / scip-java / …). The
  proven lane.
- 🟢 **supported · Tier-B** — scope-aware resolution (emits scopes + bindings); not yet oracle-measured.
- 🟣 **supported · cross-artifact** — declarative format with no scope-aware tier: Tier-A name
  matching **plus** cross-artifact stitching (definition symbols + cross-reference edges, so a Rust
  field stitches to a SQL table). No lexical scopes or read/write.
- 🟠 **planned** — a tree-sitter grammar is believed available; adding it is the mechanical recipe.
  _(Always confirm `tree-sitter >=0.24, <0.27` compatibility first — see CONTRIBUTING.)_
- 🔴 **blocked** — feasible in principle, but no usable/compatible grammar exists yet.

**Capabilities:** ✓ emitted · ⤴ via a shared extractor · — not emitted / n/a · _blank_ = not implemented yet.

Cross-language **FFI** is a property of language _pairs_, so it lives in its own matrix —
[ffi-support-matrix.md](ffi-support-matrix.md).

**23 supported** (⭐/🟢/🟣) · the rest are 🟠 planned / 🔴 blocked. The 🟠/🔴 set is illustrative, not a
queue — anything with a compatible grammar follows the same recipe.

## What every supported language gets

- **Symbols** with a SCIP-aligned `SymbolId`, `SymbolKind`, byte span, and a one-line signature.
- **Declared visibility** — `Public` / `Internal` / `Protected` / `Private` / `Unknown` — as a
  **neutral fact**. code2graph emits _all_ symbols regardless of visibility and tags each; it never
  filters to "public only" for you. `Unknown` is honest where the AST can't tell (Ruby's runtime
  visibility, dynamic conventions) — never guessed. Consumers apply their own public/private policy.
- **References** by role (`Call`, `Import`, `IsImplementation`, `TypeRef`, `Read`, `Write`), resolved
  with a `Confidence` (`Heuristic` < `NameOnly` < `Scoped` < `Exact`) and a `Provenance` (which
  analysis derived the edge).

## Honest limitations

- **Oracle coverage is 9 languages** (the ⭐ rows). Tier-B is _implemented_ more broadly (the 🟢
  rows), but only the ⭐ set has its precision/recall measured against an external compiler-grade
  index. The rest are "expected-good, not proven."
- **The type-inference ceiling is real and we don't fake past it.** Pure syntax + scope can't fully
  resolve generics, dynamic dispatch, overloads, or macro/metaprogramming-generated code. Those
  references stay at lower `Confidence` or unresolved — by design.
- **🟠/🔴 reflect grammar availability at a glance, not a commitment.** Per CONTRIBUTING, a grammar
  must be compatible with `tree-sitter >=0.24, <0.27`; we never bridge incompatible versions.
- **No source bodies** — symbols carry a byte span; the consumer slices text from it.

## Never (out of scope — deliberately not in the table)

- **Pure markup / styling (HTML, CSS)** and **prose** — too little call/reference structure to graph.
- **Generic config / data (JSON, YAML, TOML)** as first-class code graphs. (We _do_ parse specific
  manifests — `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod` — for package-coordinate
  enrichment, but we don't model arbitrary config as a symbol graph.)
- **Binary / non-source artifacts.**

## Adding a language

The recipe is mechanical and the resolver is language-agnostic, so cross-file edges work for free
once extraction emits correct facts. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-language),
including the embedded-SFC pattern and what to do when no usable grammar exists.
