# FFI support matrix

Which cross-language (cross-runtime) call boundaries code2graph bridges today — honestly, with what
is **not yet** covered.

> The canonical source is the per-ABI registry in [`src/ffi/`](../src/ffi/) — one `AbiSpec` per ABI
> (the `SPECS` table), carrying its consumer languages and export markers — plus the `FfiAbi` enum in
> [`src/graph/types.rs`](../src/graph/types.rs). A sync test (`ffi_markers_are_documented`) fails if a
> marker on this page drifts from `SPECS`; if the page still disagrees with the code, the code wins.

## What an FFI bridge is

Most static graphs stop at the language boundary: a Rust function exposed to C, or a Rust `wasm`
function called from JavaScript, is a dead end. code2graph's `FfiBridgeResolver` links a call site in
one language to a definition in another, **deterministically**:

- The **export** side is grounded in a real syntactic marker (e.g. Rust `#[no_mangle]`), recorded as
  a neutral `FfiExport { symbol, abi, export_name }`.
- The **consumer** side is matched by the exported ABI name, and only in a language that actually
  consumes that ABI (its `consumers` in the [`src/ffi/`](../src/ffi/) registry), so a C call never
  binds to a Python-only export.
- Same-language use is _not_ a bridge (that's an ordinary call).
- Every bridge edge carries `Provenance::FfiBridge` and an honest `Confidence`: `Scoped` when the
  export is unique, `NameOnly` when several share the name. Never dressed up as precise.

## The matrix

Read a cell as **the row language calling a function defined in the column language**. Columns are
only the _natively-compiled_ languages that can expose an ABI; managed/scripting languages appear as
callers (rows) only. Pairs that aren't a standard FFI boundary are left blank.

**Legend:** 🟢 bridged by code2graph today · 🟠 real FFI boundary, not bridged yet (the frontier) ·
blank = not a standard FFI pair · — same language (ordinary call, not FFI)

The 🟢 cells are exactly the bridges code2graph emits today; every 🟠 is a real, named mechanism we do
not emit yet (see [the frontier](#not-yet-covered-the-frontier)).

## How the bridges are grounded (markers)

Each FFI mechanism, named once so the matrix cells stay uncluttered. The export side is always
grounded in a real syntactic marker; the consumer side is matched by the exported name.

| PyO3                | Python → Rust                     | `#[pyfunction]` (`#[pyo3(name = "…")]` renames)       | 🟢    |

| ctypes / cffi       | Python → C                        | (runtime handle, no export marker)                    | 🟠    |

| P/Invoke            | C# → native                       | `[DllImport]` / `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]`              | 🟠    |
| cinterop / `@CName` | Kotlin/Native ↔ C                 | Kotlin `@CName`                                       | 🟠    |

Edge confidence for the 🟢 bridges: `Scoped` when the export is unique, `NameOnly` when several share
the name — always `Provenance::FfiBridge`, never dressed up as precise.

## Honest ceilings

- **Export side is Rust-centric.** Only Rust (all five ABIs) and C (JNI only) currently _produce_
  exports. "You consuming a native library" — the inverse direction — is largely not bridged yet
  (see below).
- **Call-only.** Bridges are for calls across the boundary, not shared structs/data layouts (that's
  the type-inference frontier).
- **Consumer matched by name.** No arity/signature check; ambiguity stays `NameOnly` so consumers
  can filter it.

## Not yet covered (the frontier)

These are real, common boundaries code2graph does **not** bridge today. Listed honestly so you know
the edges of the map; ranked roughly by how common the boundary is.

- **C / C++ as a first-class export side** — a C function is C-ABI callable by default, so
  `Rust extern "C" → C` and `C++ → C` (consuming a C library) should bridge but don't yet.
- **Go cgo** — `//export` / `import "C"`.
- **C# P/Invoke** — `[DllImport]` (import) and `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` (export).
- **BEAM NIFs / Rustler** — Rust `#[rustler::nif]` ↔ Elixir/Erlang (pairs with adding those
  languages).
- **Swift `@_cdecl`, Kotlin/Native `@CName` / cinterop, pybind11 / Cython (C++→Python).**
- **Python `ctypes` / `cffi` and Go cgo as consumers** — these call through a library handle
  (`lib.foo()`, `C.foo()`), a different call shape than the bare-name match used today.
- **WebAssembly component model / WIT imports** (beyond `wasm-bindgen` exports).

The architecture extends cleanly: a new boundary is one `FfiAbi` variant + one `src/ffi/<abi>.rs` spec
file (its consumer languages + export markers) + one line in the `SPECS` registry. The producer
extractor keeps its syntactic walk and calls into `ffi::` to classify the marker; the resolver is
generic — no growing match and no inline per-ABI block to extend.
