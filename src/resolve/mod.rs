//! Resolution: link references to definitions, producing cross-file edges.
//!
//! A [`Resolver`] takes per-file [`FileFacts`] and returns a resolved
//! [`CodeGraph`]. The trait is the **tier seam**: every resolver emits the same
//! schema, tagging each edge with a [`Confidence`]. codegraph ships a fast,
//! broad [`SymbolTableResolver`] (Tier A — name/scope matching across all
//! languages); a precise stack-graphs resolver (Tier B) can slot in behind the
//! same trait per language without changing the output shape.
